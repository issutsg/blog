I will not deny that there are flaws, major ones, in India, but every place in the world has those. Anyway, today is not the day to linger upon those flaws. Today is the day to celebrate this multi-cultural, multi-faceted country. Nothing beats India. Nothing at all. Nothing beats the closeness one can have for the earth like you can in India. Nothing beats the glory of the Indian ocean beating against some of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Nothing beats the monsoon rains and the taste of Masala Chai and Pakoras after doing your own version of Chak Dhoom Dhoom in the downpour. Nothing beats the stray pigs that get into your garden, ensuing in a hilarious chase scene. Nothing beats the architectural and historical beauty of the hundreds of sites around the country that should (and some are) be World Heritage Sites. Nothing beats the vivid intertwining of imagination, faith and devotion that can be seen in the multiple religions found here. Or the multitudinous dialects in which we converse but can somehow stand, perfectly understanding the thumping of our hearts, under the flag. Nothing beats the unadulterated joy at watching us win the World Cup, even if you AREN’T a cricket fan. Nothing beats the sunrise over the Himalayas, and the street football of calcutta. Nothing beats our food, and the vivacity of the colours we are able to thread together to form glorious tapestries. Nothing beats the soulful cried of a dancing peacock before the first rains. Nothing beats the peace of an Ashram, in the heart of civilization. Nothing beats the smile on a strangers face as you look at them conspiratorially while haggling for vegetables. Nothing beats Home. </p>

<p>So on this day, I say, let us put aside, just for a moment, the tumultuous troubles we are going through. Put aside religious, political, cultural, sexual difference, and join together to celebrate the world’s largest <strong>secular</strong> nation. Happy Independence Day! </p>]]></description><link>http://issuoft.ca/2014/08/14/happy-independence-day/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">0b58770b-6aa0-4fb6-8ec0-4f04ea0b6e54</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Admin]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2014 22:37:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome to the ISS Blog!]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>This is a space meant for people, like you, to enjoy a quick read about anything ISS, Indo-centric activities at UofT, or South Asian events in the GTA.</p>

<p>The ISS is a student-run organization at the University of Toronto that aims to create an at-home atmosphere for all those local and International students who love anything Indian, through our A-1 events. We all look for a way to connect with like-minded individuals when we arrive in a new environment, and that’s exactly what ISS helps to do.</p>

<p>Even though we create many avenues within the organization for students to reach out to us, we started this blog to allow members to get more personal with ISS and its executives. Through this, and many more, read(s) we hope to reach out to a lot more students who prefer to read about an event or activity in detail, rather than browse over an event page on Facebook.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy our new venture, and check back soon for upcoming events and blog posts!</p>]]></description><link>http://issuoft.ca/2014/02/10/welcome-to-the-iss-blog/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">c6ae2ecf-d87b-46f4-b203-93d33e52f3d8</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Admin]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2014 21:30:12 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
