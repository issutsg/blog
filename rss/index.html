<p>The ISS is a student-run organization at the University of Toronto that aims to create an at-home atmosphere for all those local and International students who love anything Indian, through our A-1 events. We all look for a way to connect with like-minded individuals when we arrive in a new environment, and thatâ€™s exactly what ISS helps to do.</p>

<p>Even though we create many avenues within the organization for students to reach out to us, we started this blog to allow members to get more personal with ISS and its executives. Through this, and many more, read(s) we hope to reach out to a lot more students who prefer to read about an event or activity in detail, rather than browse over an event page on Facebook.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy our new venture, and check back soon for upcoming events and blog posts!</p>]]></description><link>http://issuoft.ca/2014/02/10/welcome-to-the-iss-blog/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">c6ae2ecf-d87b-46f4-b203-93d33e52f3d8</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Admin]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2014 21:30:12 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
